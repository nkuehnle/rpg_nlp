    "# Project Overview\n",
    "In this notebook and subsequent notebooks I will attempt to predict mechanically meaningful labels associated with some fan-generated roleplaying game (RPG) content.\n",
    "\n",
    "I collected post and comment data from Reddit in multiple runs using a command-line tool I wrote for this purpose (see: [PRAW-CoDiaLS](https://github.com/nkuehnle/praw-codials))\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual text I will be attempting to predict is hosted on one of two websites: [GM Binder](https://gmbinder.com/) or [Homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/), which are tools/content hosting providers for fan-made RPG content, primarily Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition (DnD5e).\n",
    "\n",
    "The labels make use of the user-assigned \"flair\" from the subreddit [/r/UnearthedArcana](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/). UnearthedArcana describes itself as a source of \"homebrew\" (fan-generated) content and its community rules ensure that every post has a meaningful label (\"flair\") associated with it. These labels describe the \"type\" of game content that has been created, be it a character \"class\" (think achetypal high-fantasy characters: knights, wizards, archers, etc) or a \"race\" (elves, dwarves, humans, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of this document we have only the data about the Reddit submission including the submission flair link to the service described above."
